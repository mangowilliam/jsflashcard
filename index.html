      1.You should not use any of the JavaScript reserved keywords as a variable name.
      These keywords are mentioned in the next section. For example, break or boolean variable names
      are not valid.<br />
      2.JavaScript variable names should not start with a numeral (0-9). They must begin with a letter or an
      underscore character. For example, 123test is an invalid variable name but _123test is a valid one.<br />
